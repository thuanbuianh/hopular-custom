bishops,2.3,accepted,3,3,"Yesterday was Sam’s birthday. The most interesting gift was definitely the chessboard. Sam quickly learned the rules of chess and defeated his father, all his friends, his little sister, and now no one wants to play with him any more.So he decided to play with another birthday gift – a Book of Math Problems for Young Mathematicians. He opened the book somewhere in the middle and read the following problem: ""How many knights can be placed on a chessboard without threatening each other?"" After a while he realized that this was trivial and moved on to the next problem: ""How many bishops can be placed on a chessboard without threatening each other?"". Sam is in trouble here. He is not able to solve this problem and needs your help.TaskSam’s chessboard has size NxN. A bishop can move to any distance in any of the four diagonal directions. A bishop threatens another bishop if it can move to the other bishop’s position. Your task is to compute the maximum number of bishops that can be placed on a chessboard in such a way that no two bishops threaten each other.InputThe input file consists of several lines. The line number i contains a positive integer representing the size of the i-th chessboard. The size of each chessboard is at most 1000000.OutputThe output file should contain the same number of lines as the input file. The i-th line should contain one number – the maximum number of bishops that can be placed on i-th chessboard without threatening each other.",8.7,7.42,73.27,17,254,9.0,0
betting,1.3,wrong answer,0,99,"The popular streaming platform switch.tv just unveiled their newest feature: switch betting. Streamers can now get their viewers to bet on two different options using switch points (patented).Each viewer bets some number of switch points for one of the two options. The total amount of switch points bet by everyone is called the prize pool. The streamer will choose one of the options as the winner and the prize pool is split (not necessarily equally) between all the viewers who bet on that option; the more you bet on the option, the more of the prize pool you receive. In particular, if you contributed p% of all the bets for one of the options and that option wins, then you receive p% of the total prize pool.The switch.tv team has come to you to compute what the switch point payout is for each viewer if their selected option wins. To do this, they ask you to find the switch-payout-ratio for each of the two options. Since the payout to each viewer is proportional to the number of switch points they put into the bet, the switch team will be able to use this ratio to determine each viewer’s winnings.For example, suppose a streamer created a switch bet where three viewers participated. Two viewers bet 10 and 30 switch points on option one and the last viewer bets 10 switch points on option two. We can see that option one has 80% of the bets and option two has 20% of the bets.If option one wins, then the two viewers who bet on that receive 12.5 and 37.5 switch points, respectively, which means that the switch-payout-ratio is 1 : 1.25 for option one. If option two wins, then the single viewer who bets on that receives 50 switch points, which means that the switch-payout-ratio is 1 : 5.Given the percentage of total bets for option one, help switch.tv by computing the switch-payout-ratio for the two options.InputThe input consists of one integer a (0<a<100), which is the percentage of switch points bet on option one.OutputFor each option (option one, then option two), display the number x such that 1:x is the switch-payout-ratio for that option.

Sometimes you even suspect he loses his count! You decide to write a program to determine whether Arild’s counting makes sense or not.InputThe first line of input contains an integer n (1<=n<=1000), the number of bites Arild receives. Then second line contains n space-separated words spoken by Arild, the i’th of which is either a non-negative integer a-i (0<=a-i<=10000) or the string “mumble”.OutputIf Arild’s counting might make sense, print the string “makes sense”.

a_towering_problem,2.3,RTE,0,50,"You are given six sticks of lengths $a_1,a_2,a_3,b_1,b_2$ and $b_3$.Determine if you can arrange the sticks into two non-overlapping towers of the same height. In each tower, one stick is stacked on top of another stick, which is possibly stacked on top of a third stick. However, the height of the two towers must be the same, and the sticks in each tower must be strictly decreasing in length from bottom to top.For example, if the sticks have lengths $a_1=10, a_2=3, a_3=3, b_1=4, b_2=2,$ and $b_3=1$, then one tower could be formed by the sticks $10,3,$ and $1$, and the other tower could be formed by the sticks $4,3$, and $2$.

stop_counting!,5.3,wrong answer,0,21,"Solve in Python and justify:The Martingale casino is creating new games to lure in new gamblers who tire of the standard fare. Their latest invention is a fast-paced game of chance called Stop Counting!, where a single customer plays with a dealer who has a deck of cards. Each card has some integer value.One by one, the dealer reveals the cards in the deck in order, and keeps track of the sum of the played cards and the number of cards shown. At some point before a card is dealt, the player can call “Stop Counting!” After this, the dealer continues displaying cards in order, but does not include them in the running sums. At some point after calling “Stop Counting!”, and just before another card is dealt, the player can also call “Start Counting!” and the dealer then includes subsequent cards in the totals. The player can only call “Stop Counting!” and “Start Counting!” at most once each, and they must call “Stop Counting!” before they can call “Start Counting!”. A card is “counted” if it is dealt before the player calls “Stop Counting!” or is dealt after the player calls “Start Counting!”The payout of the game is then the average value of the counted cards. That is, it is the sum of the counted cards divided by the number of counted cards. If there are no counted cards, the payout is 0.You have an ‘in’ with the dealer, and you know the full deck in order ahead of time. What is the maximum payout you can achieve?InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer 1 \leq N \leq 1\,000\,000, the number of cards in the deck.The second line of input contains N space-separated integers, the values on the cards. The value of each card is in the range [-10^{9}, 10^{9}]. The cards are dealt in the same order they are given in the input.OutputOutput the largest attainable payout. The answer is considered correct if the absolute error is less than 10^{-6}, or the relative error is less than 10^{-9}.Sample ExplanationIn the first sample, by calling “Stop Counting!” before the -10 and “Start Counting!” before the final 10, we can achieve an average of 10.0 with the cards that are counted.In the second sample, all values are negative, so the best strategy is to call “Stop Counting!” before the first card is dealt and call “Start Counting!” after the last card is dealt. Since no cards were counted, the average of the counted cards is 0.0.Sample Input 1510 10 -10 -4 10Sample Output 110.000000000Sample Input 24-3 -1 -4 -1Sample Output 20.000000000",6.7,7.02,76.52,37,434,7.0,21

Occasionally, a goose would attack one of the people, and perhaps bite off a finger or two, but in general, the people tolerated the geese as a minor nuisance.One day, a freak mutation occurred, and one of the geese spawned a multi-headed fire-breathing dragon. When the dragon grew up, he threatened to burn the Kingdom of Loowater to a crisp. Loowater had a major problem. The king was alarmed, and called on his knights to slay the dragon and save the kingdom.The knights explained: “To slay the dragon, we must chop off all its heads. Each knight can chop off one of the dragon’s heads. The heads of the dragon are of different sizes. In order to chop off a head, a knight must be at least as tall as the diameter of the head. The knights’ union demands that for chopping off a head, a knight must be paid a wage equal to one gold coin for each centimetre of the knight’s height.”Would there be enough knights to defeat the dragon?

Then repeat the following:if xi is even, then x(i+1) = xi/2 (“half …”)if xi is odd, then x(i+1) = 3xi +1 (“…or triple plus one”)The Collatz Conjecture says that every such sequence will eventually reach 1. It has still not been proven until today but we already know for sure that this is true for every x- < 2^58. (Never tell this to aliens!)In this problem, you are given two starting values and your task is to say after how many steps their sequences “meet” for the first time (which means the first number that occurs in both sequences) and at which number is it going to happen. For simplicity, we will assume that the sequence does not continue once it has reached the number one. In reality, it would then turn into 1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, ..., which quickly becomes boring.InputThe input contains at most 1500 test cases. Each test case is described by a single line containing two integer numbers A and B, 1 <= A,B <= 1000000.The last test case is followed by a line containing two zeros.OutputFor each test case, output the sentence “A needs SA steps, B needs SB steps, they meet at C”, where SA and SB are the number of steps needed in both sequences to reach the same number C. Follow the output format precisely.Sample Input 17 827 300 0Sample Output 17 needs 13 steps, 8 needs 0 steps, they meet at 827 needs 95 steps, 30 needs 2 steps, they meet at 46",10.0,8.57,69.52,18,335,10.0,2

alchemy,8.9,wrong answer,3,76,"Solve in Python, Format your answer with proper indentation and justifyYou just finished day one of your alchemy class! For your alchemy homework, you have been given a string of lowercase letters and wish to make it a palindrome. You’re only a beginner at alchemy though, so your powers are limited. In a single operation, you may choose exactly two adjacent letters and change each of them into a different lowercase letter. The resulting characters may be the same as or different from one another, so long as they were both changed by the operation.Formally, if the string before the operation is s and you chose to change characters si and si+1 to produce string t, then si not equal to ti and si+1 is not equal to ti+1 must be true, but ti = ti+1 is permitted.Compute the minimum number of operations needed to make the string a palindrome.InputThe single line of input contains a string of  n (2<= n<= 100) lowercase letters, the string you are converting into a palindrome.OutputOutput a single integer, which is the minimum number of operations needed to make the string a palindrome.#GPT did not follow the rules of the problem for its initial answer, I had to correct it in order to make actually attempt this problem.This is incorrect as you need to change two operations at a timeRewrite the program to need to change two letters at a time",11.5,8.18,58.11,11,236,11.0,73
chasing_the_cheetahs,5.2,wrong answer,1,60,"Solve in Python. Use proper formatting and justifyA National Geographic film crew is visiting the ZOO this week. They are creating a documentary about animal speed and they would like to film one or more cheetahs running at full pace. A solitary running cheetah has been filmed successfully many times. Therefore, the crew is also after a much more spectacular feat: As many as possible cheetahs sprinting on parallel tracks filmed together in one shot.“No, that is impossible,” said the director. “We cannot squeeze those animals into some sort of a start box, as you probably imagine, and then open the box and make them run all at once. It is clearly too dangerous and unpredictable. No.”“Then let us make more boxes and open some of them earlier and some of them later,” said one of the filmmakers. “Could that work?”“And if we open the boxes with the slower cheetahs a bit earlier then after a while the faster ones will be overtaking the slower ones and that would be a great shot,” pointed out another filmmaker. “We would like to see the whole pack rather short with the last animals close the leading ones. As close as possible and at least for a moment.”It was a long and difficult discussion which ensued, but in the end the circumstances of the experiment were agreed upon.You are given the start time and the speed of each cheetah. The length of the pack, which is defined as the distance between the first and the last cheetah in the pack, might be different at different moments. Find the minimum length of the pack during the run, where all cheetahs must be running. You may also suppose that the track is so long that the minimum length of the pack happens at least a moment before the first cheetah reaches the finish line.All start boxes will be so close that you may consider them to be in the same place. The k-th cheetah will be released from its start box at the given time tk. The k-th cheetah is expected to run the whole distance at constant speed vk.InputThe first line contains the number of cheetahs N ( 1<= N <= 100000). Next, there are N lines, each line contains two integers tk, vk separated by spaces and representing the start time and velocity of the k-th cheetah (1 < k <= N). All input values tk and vk are positive and less than 10^5.OutputPrint a single line with one floating point number L specifying the minimum length of the running pack. Your answer should not differ from the correct answer by more than 10^(-2). The length of the pack is the distance between the first and the last animal in the pack. The length can be measured at any time  T >= maxk=1,..., Ntk. We suppose that each cheetah is running at a constant speed for all the time from the start and also at its moment of release from the start box.Sample Input 121 11 1Sample Output 10.000Sample Input 221 9999999999 99999Sample Output 29999700002.000Sample Input 331 13 24 3Sample Output 30.500",8.5,7.6,72.05,32,514,9.0,59
