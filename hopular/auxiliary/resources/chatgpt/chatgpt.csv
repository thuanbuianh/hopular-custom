bishops,2.3,0,3,3,"Yesterday was Sam’s birthday. The most interesting gift was definitely the chessboard. Sam quickly learned the rules of chess and defeated his father, all his friends, his little sister, and now no one wants to play with him any more.So he decided to play with another birthday gift – a Book of Math Problems for Young Mathematicians. He opened the book somewhere in the middle and read the following problem: ""How many knights can be placed on a chessboard without threatening each other?"" After a while he realized that this was trivial and moved on to the next problem: ""How many bishops can be placed on a chessboard without threatening each other?"". Sam is in trouble here. He is not able to solve this problem and needs your help.TaskSam’s chessboard has size NxN. A bishop can move to any distance in any of the four diagonal directions. A bishop threatens another bishop if it can move to the other bishop’s position. Your task is to compute the maximum number of bishops that can be placed on a chessboard in such a way that no two bishops threaten each other.InputThe input file consists of several lines. The line number i contains a positive integer representing the size of the i-th chessboard. The size of each chessboard is at most 1000000.OutputThe output file should contain the same number of lines as the input file.

betting,1.3,2,0,99,"The popular streaming platform switch.tv just unveiled their newest feature: switch betting. Streamers can now get their viewers to bet on two different options using switch points (patented).Each viewer bets some number of switch points for one of the two options. The total amount of switch points bet by everyone is called the prize pool. The streamer will choose one of the options as the winner and the prize pool is split (not necessarily equally) between all the viewers who bet on that option; the more you bet on the option, the more of the prize pool you receive. In particular, if you contributed p% of all the bets for one of the options and that option wins, then you receive p% of the total prize pool.The switch.tv team has come to you to compute what the switch point payout is for each viewer if their selected option wins. To do this, they ask you to find the switch-payout-ratio for each of the two options. Since the payout to each viewer is proportional to the number of switch points they put into the bet, the switch team will be able to use this ratio to determine each viewer’s winnings.For example, suppose a streamer created a switch bet where three viewers participated. Two viewers bet 10 and 30 switch points on option one and the last viewer bets 10 switch points on option two. We can see that option one has 80% of the bets and option two has 20% of the bets.If option one wins, then the two viewers who bet on that receive 12.5 and 37.5 switch points, respectively, which means that the switch-payout-ratio is 1 : 1.25 for option one. If option two wins, then the single viewer who bets on that receives 50 switch points, which means that the switch-payout-ratio is 1 : 5.Given the percentage of total bets for option one, help switch.tv by computing the switch-payout-ratio for the two options.InputThe input consists of one integer a (0<a<100), which is the percentage of switch points bet on option one.OutputFor each option (option one, then option two), display the number x such that 1:x is the switch-payout-ratio for that option.

apaxians!,1.4,0,41,41,"The ancient and mysterious Apaxian civilization, which we most certainly did not make up, continues to confound the researchers at the Oriental Institute. It turns out that the Apaxians had a peculiar naming system: the more letters in your name, the higher your status in society. So, in Apaxian society, robert was probably a lowly servant, and robertapalaxiamethostenes was likely a High Priest or Minister. Even more than that, Apaxians valued the number of adjacent letters that were the same in a name. So, while robert continues to be an unimpressive name, roooooooooobert probably elicited cheers and applause wherever he went.Unfortunately, this makes the task of reading Apaxian scrolls very cumbersome, especially when you consider that a particularly famous Apaxian queen had ten thousand consecutive a’s in her name. Legend has it that she was already two years old by the time the Royal Herald finished announcing her birth.To make the Oriental Institute’s life easier, the Department of Computer Science has offered to convert the Apaxian scrolls into a more readable format. Specifically, we will be taking Apaxian names and replacing all consecutive runs of the same letter by a single instance of such letter.So, for example, the compact version of roooobert would be robert, where the four consecutive o’s have been replaced with a single o. Similarly, the compact version of rrrooobbbert would also be robert. On the other hand, the compact version of robert is still robert.InputThe input contains a single name. Each name contains only lowercase letters (a–z), no whitespace, a minimum length of 1 character, and a maximum length of 250 characters.OutputThe output contains the compact version of the name: any time the same letter appears two or more times in sequence, it must be replaced by a single instance of that letter.",13.1,9.24,51.38,15,297,14,0

stream_lag,3.2,2,0,20,"solve in python and justifyLive stream audiences often encounter undesired stream lag. The lag may occur for multiple reasons, such as slow network speed, high stream resolution, not enough processing power on the client hardware, etc. In this problem, we will model and compute the stream lag for one hypothetical stream.The stream has a video content that is segmented into  network packets to send, numbered from 1 to n. Each packet contains a small segment of the streamed video with a length of exactly one second. A stream lag is a time period in which the stream audience is not watching any content while waiting for the stream packets to arrive. Ideally, a stream audience experiencing zero lag shall receive packet i at the beginning of the ith second, in which case the audience can seamlessly watch the entire streamed video.In reality, any of the n packets may be received at any moment, and not necessarily in order from 1 to n. A stream client will only start playing packet i if it has played all its preceding packets. If this is not the case, the stream client will wait until all packets before i have been received and played. The stream client keeps all received packets that cannot yet be played in its buffer and is able to retrieve them in no time when they are ready to be played. If a packet is not available when the time to play it arrives, the stream lags and viewers fall behind from the live stream. The stream client plays each packet for exactly one second at its original speed.

In the 2nd, 3rd and 4th leg, the runner is already running when the baton is handed over.

The probe destination is an asteroid named Silver Star after its unexpectedly bright ultraviolet albedo. The journey of the probe will be long, and it may visit some other asteroids on the way. The set of candidate asteroids to be visited, including Silver Star, has been carefully chosen so that they are on the path from Mars to Silver Star and the sequence of their distances from Mars expressed in AU and arranged in ascending order, is the sequence of the first few prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, \dots.

batter_up,1.4,0,20,20,"While the Chicago Cubs were ecstatic with their 2016 World Series championship, they were eliminated from the playoffs in 2017. Looking ahead to 2018 they are beginning to embrace the more data-driven analysis of player’s values known as Sabermetrics.For example, a player’s batting average is calculated by dividing the total number of base hits by the total number of official at-bats. One limitation of using the batting average to evaluate players is that it treats all hits equally, rather than taking into account doubles, triples or home runs. For this reason, analysts often prefer to consider what is known as the slugging percentage, which distinguishes between different hit outcomes. To calculate the slugging percentage, the total number of bases of all hits is divided by the total numbers of time at bat, that did not result in walks, or at-bats.More specifically, an at-bat can earn 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 bases (these are referred to as official at-bats). Furthermore, some at-bats, such as those that result in a base-on-balls (i.e., a ""walk"") are not considered in either the player’s batting average or slugging percentage.For example, if a player hits a triple (3 bases), strikes out (0 bases), and hits a double (2 bases), their slugging percentage would be (3+0+2)/3 = 1.6667. If a player hits a single (1 base), walks, and hits a home run (4 bases), the slugging level would be (1+4)/2=2.5. Notice that in this case, the denominator is two, not three, because the walk does not count towards the slugging percentage.InputThe input is composed of two lines. The first line contains a single positive integer n (1<=n<=100) that specifies the number of at-bats. The second line contains n integers, separated by spaces, each describing one of those at-bats. Strike-outs, singles, doubles, triples, and home runs are represented as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, respectively. Walks are represented as -1. You may assume that there will always be at least one official at-bat (i.e., at least one at-bat will not be a walk).OutputDisplay the player’s slugging percentage as a real number, accurate to within an absolute or relative error of 10^-3.

babylonian_numbers,2,1,0,4,"More than 4000 years ago, the ancient Babylonians used a numerical system that is well known for being the first positional numerical system. In such a system, a non-negative integer is represented by a sequence of digits such that the value of a digit depends both on itself and on its position within the sequence. The Babylonians used a base-60system known as sexagesimal (not unlike our own base-10 decimal system) where each 'digit' can take values between 1 and 59, inclusive. (The Babylonians didn't have a digit to represent 0; instead they would just leave the digit position empty.) Akin to the Egyptians at the time, the Babylonians carved their equations in solid clay, which allows us to read them thousands of years later.Your history professor, Dr. X, has asked you to decipher the Babylonian numbers he has found during a recent excavation and to convert them into our own decimal numerical system. As you are a competent translator, you have no problem deciphering the Babylonian writing, but you now need to write a program that takes the sexagesimal notation and converts it to decimal.Fortunately, each clay tablet discovered by Dr. X contains numbers in a clean format where digits corresponding to consecutive powers of 60 are separated by commas, with the most significant digit on the left. For instance, one tablet contains the Babylonian number 1,24,9 in sexagesimal, which converts to 5049 in decimal, since 1x60^2+24x60^1+9x60^0=5049.InputThe first line contains an integer N (1<=N<=20), the number of test cases to follow.Each of the following N lines represents a single tablet containing a number in sexagesimal format. This number is a non-empty sequence of digits separated by commas. Nonzero digits can be any integers between 1 and 59 (inclusive), and 0 is represented by an empty string. The sexagesimal number does not begin with a comma, contains at least one nonzero digit, and consists of D digits in total, where 1<=D<=8.OutputFor each test case, output a line containing the decimal representation of the sexagesimal number.",12.8,9.05,43.12,17,334,12,4

Because there is only a single mech unit available after previous monster rampages, the EDF has decided to simulate the upcoming battle between the mech and the monster before launching an assault. The EDF noted that the monster’s attack pattern can be simulated by a series of moves that it performs in succession. When denoting each of its moves with a single letter, the attack pattern can be simulated as a single string, which should be read from left to right. The monster has the following moves:Rake, denoted by the letter ‘R’;Bite, denoted by the letter ‘B’;Laser breath, denoted by the letter ‘L’.In order to defeat the monster, the mech must perform a counter move per move that the monster makes:Slice, denoted by the letter ‘S’, counters the monster’s rake;Kick, denoted by the letter ‘K’, counters the monster’s bite;Shield, denoted by the letter ‘H’, counters the monster’s laser breath;However, there is one catch. When the monster performs a subsequent combination of the three moves Rake, Bite and Laser breath, in any order, it becomes a very powerful attack for which the mech must perform a single counter move called Combo breaker, denoted by the letter ‘C’. A single Combo breaker absorbs the entire combination of three moves. Any following moves from the monster will have to be countered separately or as part of a new combination.

At some point after calling ""Stop Counting!"", and just before another card is dealt, the player can also call ""Start Counting!"" and the dealer then includes subsequent cards in the totals. The player can only call ""Stop Counting!"" and ""Start Counting!"" at most once each, and they must call ""Stop Counting!"" before they can call ""Start Counting!"". A card is ""counted"" if it is dealt before the player calls ""Stop Counting!"" or is dealt after the player calls ""Start Counting!""The payout of the game is then the average value of the counted cards. That is, it is the sum of the counted cards divided by the number of counted cards. If there are no counted cards, the payout is 0.You have an ‘in’ with the dealer, and you know the full deck in order ahead of time. What is the maximum payout you can achieve?InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer 1 \leq N \leq 1\,000\,000, the number of cards in the deck.The second line of input contains N space-separated integers, the values on the cards. The value of each card is in the range [-10^{9}, 10^{9}]. The cards are dealt in the same order they are given in the input.OutputOutput the largest attainable payout. The answer is considered correct if the absolute error is less than 10^{-6}, or the relative error is less than 10^{-9}.Sample ExplanationIn the first sample, by calling ""Stop Counting!"" before the -10 and ""Start Counting!"" before the final 10, we can achieve an average of 10.0 with the cards that are counted.In the second sample, all values are negative, so the best strategy is to call ""Stop Counting!"" before the first card is dealt and call ""Start Counting!"" after the last card is dealt. Since no cards were counted, the average of the counted cards is 0.0.Sample Input 1510 10 -10 -4 10Sample Output 110.000000000Sample Input 24-3 -1 -4 -1Sample Output 20.000000000",6.7,7.02,76.52,37,434,7,21

They have found n beautiful bushes. They decided to use these bushes to mark the border of their kingdom.Unfortunately, cats are not so good at geometry, so they want the border to be a polygon with exactly four sides. Additionally, to avoid confusion, for each pair of points inside the polygon, all points on the segment connecting the pair must also lie inside the polygon. In other words, the border must be a convex polygon. As their plan is still under discussion, the cats want you to tell them how many ways to choose the border satisfying all their needs.More formally, given n points on a Cartesian coordinate plane, you should count the number of convex polygons with positive area whose all  vertices are amongst the 4 points.InputThe input contains multiple test cases.

acm_contest_scoring,1.7,2,0,7,"Our new contest submission system keeps a chronological log of all submissions made by each team during the contest. With each entry, it records the number of minutes into the competition at which the submission was received, the letter that identifies the relevant contest problem, and the result of testing the submission (designated for the sake of this problem simply as right or wrong). As an example, the following is a hypothetical log for a particular team:3 E right10 A wrong30 C wrong50 B wrong100 A wrong200 A right250 C wrong300 D rightThe rank of a team relative to others is determined by a primary and secondary scoring measure calculated from the submission data. The primary measure is the number of problems that were solved. The secondary measure is based on a combination of time and penalties. Specifically, a team's time score is equal to the sum of those submission times that resulted in right answers, plus a 20-minute penalty for each wrong submission of a problem that is ultimately solved. If no problems are solved, the time measure is 0.In the above example, we see that this team successfully completed three problems: E on their first attempt (3 minutes into the contest); A on their third attempt at that problem (200 minutes into the contest); and D on their first attempt at that problem (300 minutes into the contest). This team's time score (including penalties) is 543. This is computed to include 3 minutes for solving E, 200 minutes for solving A with an additional 40 penalty minutes for two earlier mistakes on that problem, and finally 300 minutes for solving D. Note that the team also attempted problems B and C, but were never successful in solving those problems, and thus received no penalties for those attempts.According to contest rules, after a team solves a particular problem, any further submissions of the same problem are ignored (and thus omitted from the log). Because times are discretized to whole minutes, there may be more than one submission showing the same number of minutes. In particular there could be more than one submission of the same problem in the same minute, but they are chronological, so only the last entry could possibly be correct.

""Could that work?""""And if we open the boxes with the slower cheetahs a bit earlier then after a while the faster ones will be overtaking the slower ones and that would be a great shot,"" pointed out another filmmaker. ""We would like to see the whole pack rather short with the last animals close the leading ones. As close as possible and at least for a moment.""It was a long and difficult discussion which ensued, but in the end the circumstances of the experiment were agreed upon.You are given the start time and the speed of each cheetah. The length of the pack, which is defined as the distance between the first and the last cheetah in the pack, might be different at different moments. Find the minimum length of the pack during the run, where all cheetahs must be running. You may also suppose that the track is so long that the minimum length of the pack happens at least a moment before the first cheetah reaches the finish line.All start boxes will be so close that you may consider them to be in the same place. The k-th cheetah will be released from its start box at the given time tk. The k-th cheetah is expected to run the whole distance at constant speed vk.InputThe first line contains the number of cheetahs N ( 1<= N <= 100000). Next, there are N lines, each line contains two integers tk, vk separated by spaces and representing the start time and velocity of the k-th cheetah (1 < k <= N). All input values tk and vk are positive and less than 10^5.OutputPrint a single line with one floating point number L specifying the minimum length of the running pack. Your answer should not differ from the correct answer by more than 10^(-2). The length of the pack is the distance between the first and the last animal in the pack. The length can be measured at any time  T >= maxk=1,..., Ntk. We suppose that each cheetah is running at a constant speed for all the time from the start and also at its moment of release from the start box.Sample Input 121 11 1Sample Output 10.000Sample Input 221 9999999999 99999Sample Output 29999700002.000Sample Input 331 13 24 3Sample Output 30.500",8.5,7.6,72.05,32,514,9,59

He is always happy to share candies with his friends, because then he doesn’t have to eat them alone and get fat. There is one problem, though.

metronome,1.3,2,1,20,"MetronomeA Metronome is a mechanical device used by musicians for keeping time. It is a very clever device, based on a spring, an inverted pendulum, and an escapement gear. Milo is learning to play the glockenspiel, and has purchased a metronome to help him keep time. Milo has noticed that for every complete turn (one revolution) of the key, the metronome will give four ticks. Milo wants the metronome to stop at the end of each song that he tries to play.For a given song, how many revolutions must he wind the key?InputThe single line of input contains a single integer n (1<=n<=10^5), which is the length of the song in ticks.OutputOutput a single real number, which is the number of revolutions Milo must turn the metronome’s key so that it stops precisely at the end of the song. This number must be accurate to two decimal places.",8.8,8.4,71.75,9,148,8,19
the_white_rabbit_pocket_watch,3.9,2,0,17,"solve in python and justify:Alice: How can it be?Rabbit: Trust me Alice. It always takes the same time. When I go from my home up the road to Queen of Hearts’ Castle, my watch counts nine hours. However, if I continue down to Mad Hatter’s House, my watch counts just two hours in total. Isn’t that great?Alice: How can it be Rabbit? The path is longer and you take a shorter time to do it? How can it be?Rabbit: Trust me Alice! It is all recorded in my logbook. You can check it. All my trips are there...Alice: Rabbit, I do not think it can help me...Rabbit: Alice, no matter where you are, or where you want to go, or the track you choose, you’ll be able to find how long it takes you.Alice: Really?Rabbit: For sure! Poor Rabbit, poor Alice.White Rabbit is helping Alice finding a quick way home through the Rabbit’s hole with his holy logbook of trips. The problem lies in the chronometer of its bizarre pocket watch (it displays the hours from zero to 12), and the way the Rabbit counts the time with it: If a journey takes 14 hours (real time), seeing the pointer resting above number one, he assumes it took one hour.Given that the White Rabbit is telling the truth, can you help Alice finding how long the shortest path home takes, using the Rabbit’s logbook of trips?TaskYour task is to find the shortest real time it takes for Alice to go from her present location to the Rabbit’s hole. For each trip, the White Rabbit wrote down the trip time, the number of visited locations (not necessarily distinct) and the sequence in which they were visited. That sequence defines the trip because there is at most one direct track between any two locations in the Wonderland and it takes the same time both ways. The White rabbit’s logbook contains trips using all roads in Wonderland; there are no direct connections beyond those implied by the trips in the log book.InputThe first line contains four integers N, A, R and T, where: N is the number of distinct locations; A identifies the place where Alice is located; R corresponds to the Rabbit’s hole location; and T is the number of trips recorded in White Rabbit’s logbook. All locations are identified by numbers from 1 to N. Each of the next T lines describes a trip logged with format d \, \, p \, \, a_{1} \,\, a_{2} \, \cdots \, a_{p}, where d is the trip duration (according to White Rabbit), p is the number of locations and a_{1} \, \, a_{2} \, \cdots \, a_{p} is the sequence of visited locations.Constraints2 <= N <= 200 Number of locations1 <= T <= 500 Number of trips in the logbook2 <= p <= 800 Number of (possibly repeated) locations in a trip1 <= d_{ij} <= 12Real time of the direct track between a_{i} and a{j} (if it exists)There are at most 200 direct tracks.
